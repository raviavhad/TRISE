# TRISE

**Inspiration**
Let's start with a definition of the future of work, workplace, and workforce. These are becoming more common as part of the new normal. On a more detailed level, the evolution of remote working as a result of workplace transformation may be seen. We shall live in a hybrid society that accepts hybrid workplaces as we emerge from crises in the post-pandemic period. In this climate, the key to business success is to harness developing talent models to exploit the power of skilled labour across global boundaries (which used to be a constraint prior to the pandemic). Similarly, this has opened up a flood of options for gig workers and talents, including rural labour, to participate in corporate developments. The concept of full-time employment will grow even more gloomy in the coming years, as skill marketplaces pick up speed, boosting commoditization and fracturing work into jobs. Blockchain and associated technologies are surely one critical technology that will permit end-to-end working in this Future of Work. It's encouraging to see mature talks about blockchain technology's applications expand beyond the shadows of just one of them â€” cryptocurrency. Meta, as a company that creates virtual worlds, is focused on the internet's future. Blockchain and cryptocurrency, according to Wall Street Bank and Goldman Sachs, will be at the center of the digital and virtual worlds, allowing people to safely own digital objects across many virtual realms.

**What it does**
As part of timesheet milestone achievement, every agreed milestones entitles them to receive teconomy tokens which are saved on archieved on IPFS .IPFS allows us to access permanent data storage with instant and guaranteed transaction finality. Our platform allow the user to login with teconomy account and access their multiple wallets including CryptoCurrency wallet.They can link multiple accounts from different network and they will have option of choosing their preferred account for compensation.Users will also have options of redeeming these tokens for currency of their choice in future.

The goal is to build a marketplace platform that links talent with more possibilities to change more lives, while also giving businesses the reach and speed they need. This concept is meant to go beyond the typical freelancing paradigm to include all types of skills and businesses. In a future where hybrid (physical + remote) models will be the new normal for organizations undergoing large-scale digital transformations, this platform powered by Ciricle Network, IPFS and CryptoCurrency blockchain will be vital to the success of numerous today's system integrators in remaining relevant and resilient. In such cases, blockchain could prove to be a godsend in terms of making smarter, data-driven talent selections. The outcomes of this study indicate the reality about employment in the aftermath of a pandemic. Some performance issues and unpleasant separations may have been avoided with thorough background checks, according to Marketplace users. Employers can verify employment history and qualifications, such as degrees and certificates, using blockchain-based technology. Employers can save a lot of time and money by implementing blockchain-based solutions to conduct background checks, check each referral, and better deal with information asymmetry.

**Significant Characteristics**

**How we built it**
Automation and hyper productivity are core dimensions of platform development approach. On the foundation of Quickbase **low code no code** platform - developed multiple workflows that encompass modules of **collect payments, beneficiary addition and validation, disburse individual/mass payouts, wallet to wallet transfer, recurring payouts in defined interval, escrow feature, FX support** supported by additional modules of project execution covering admin, originator and work performers.

Platform is integrated with Circle api endpoints for above referred payment capabilities - **Collect, Disburse, Wallet and Point of Sale**

Low code platform allowed to adapt and innovate with speed that matches the pace of change in today's business environment. Decision to adapt the low code in development supported us to iterate on the features in a faster and more productive way giving us the much needed flexibility of creating more, improving, and maintaining business workflows. This resulted in Trise platform with resilience at multiple levels - technology, operations and experience to suite the market demand.

Circle API are core of the platform and this integration was seamless because of the self sufficient documentation available on Circle developer portal. Available endpoints at Postman allowed to work in parallel to test the workflows. 

**Challenges we ran into**
Integration challenges between low code platform and Circle API endpoints. This enforced us to think differently - developed additional layer of abstraction exposing course grained Circle API end points that matches the workflow requirements deployed on IBM cloud. 

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
End to end marketplace platform beyond traditional model to address the future needs of work, workforce, workplace. Platform will be gamechanger to stakeholders including larger enterprises where they could adopt Trise as backbone to project executions. Example - In built **project management suites** makes the platform distinguished to current players and **one stop solution to projects of any size.** 

Such envisioned platform at scale demands additional payments requirements - **cross border** payments and payouts methods, seamless in real-time **global payment** coverage including multiple channels - cards, bank transfers, e-wallets and cash, security at core and fraud prevention. All these have been implemented with Circle provided features.

Project management features include real time insights on progress, tasks, time sheets, expenses, budgets and suite of reports & dashboards.

In addition, quickbase has extended measure on security front -Strictest compliance certifications and attestations, including SOC 1 / SOC2, HIPAA, EU-US Privacy Shield and DFARS

For Escrow payment and failed payments scenarios, Trise is **integrated with Salesforce service cloud** to address offline transactions
